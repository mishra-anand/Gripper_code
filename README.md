# Gripper_code-
Integrated vision and tactile sensing and control
Purpose / brief description
Python code for a soft robotic gripper that fuses monocular vision and embedded tactile/pressure sensing to detect object shape/size and control pneumatic actuation (open/close/hold). Core scripts include camera acquisition, detection, size/shape estimation, and pressure/LED control combined in an “integrated_code.py” runner.
